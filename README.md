# SaltIdentificationKaggle

This kaggle project is identifying the part of subsurface which is salt.\
salt.ipynb is trained without feature, which is depth in depth.csv.\
predict.ipynb is trained with feature.\
salt.ipynb got a bit better result, so we can know that depth is not really related to salt proportion.
